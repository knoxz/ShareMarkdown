---

### **6. Considerations and Best Practices**

#### **6.1. Security Best Practices**

- **Limit Permissions:**
  - Ensure the `functional-user` only has the necessary permissions for the `internal-app-repo`.
- **Token Management:**
  - Use tokens with appropriate expiration times. Tokens that never expire can pose a risk if compromised.
- **User Accountability:**
  - Sharing a single token among multiple users can make it difficult to track individual actions. Consider these options:
    - **Individual Tokens:** Generate individual tokens for each user, even if they use the same functional account.
    - **User Accounts:** Create individual user accounts for better accountability.
- **Revocation Mechanism:**
  - In case a token is compromised, you can revoke it from the **Access Tokens** section.

#### **6.2. Alternative Access Methods**

- **API Keys:**
  - Instead of access tokens, you can use API keys associated with the functional account.
- **SSH Authentication:**
  - Artifactory supports SSH authentication for downloading artifacts.

---

### **7. Communicate with Your Users**

- **Provide Clear Instructions:**
  - Write documentation or an email that includes:
    - How to download and run the setup script.
    - The importance of keeping the access token secure.
    - Who to contact for support.
- **Support Channels:**
  - Establish a support system (e.g., email, chat, ticketing system) for users who might face issues.

---

### **8. Maintaining and Updating the Application**

#### **8.1. Uploading New Versions**

- **Versioning:**
  - When uploading new versions, include version numbers in the file name, e.g., `my-app-1.0.1.zip`.
- **Notify Users:**
  - Inform users when a new version is available.
- **Automated Updates:**
  - Modify the download script to always fetch the latest version.

  ```bash
  # List all versions
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" "$ARTIFACTORY_URL/api/storage/$REPO_PATH?list&deep=0" | grep 'uri' | awk -F'"' '{print $4}'

  # Logic to determine the latest version and download it
  ```

#### **8.2. Cleanup Old Versions**

- **Artifact Cleanup Policies:**
  - Set up policies in Artifactory to clean up old artifacts if necessary.
- **Repository Disk Space Management:**
  - Regularly monitor the repository size and manage artifacts accordingly.

---
